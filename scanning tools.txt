What is Nmap
Network administrators can use Nmap for inventorying a network, managing service upgrade schedules and monitoring host or service uptime.
Attackers use Nmap to extract information such as live hosts on the network, open ports, services (application name and version) types of packet filters/firewalls as well as operating system and version used. 

1.	Run a basic ping sweep on the network
    nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 
2.	Port Scanning
    Identify open ports and services to assess potential attack 
    nmap -sT 192.168.1.0/24
3.	Service Version Detection
    nmap -sV 192.168.1.10
4.	Operating System Detection for Device Profiling
    Profile the operating systems of devices to identify potential weak points in OS-specific security.
5.	Perform an OS detection scan using Nmap
    nmap -O 192.168.1.0/24
6.	Firewall Rule Testing with Stealth Scan
    Verify the firewall’s configuration by attempting to bypass detection using stealth scans.
    nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24
7.	UDP Scan for Open UDP Services
    Discover any open UDP ports to check for insecure or unnecessary
    nmap -sU 192.168.1.0/24
8.	 Banner Grabbing to Identify
    Identify software versions or configurations by collecting banner information from exposed services.
    nmap -sV --script=banner 192.168.1.10
